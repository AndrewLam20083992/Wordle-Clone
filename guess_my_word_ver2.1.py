"""Guess-My-Word is a game where the player has to guess a word.
<1. User has to guess the word of the day in 6 attempts or less
2. Only valid English words can be guessed (guesses should be words in the word bank)
3. If the letter and position is correct, it will output 'X'
4. If the letter is correct but the position is wrong, it will output 'O'
5. An incorrect letter will output '_'
6. Letters can be used multiple times for different guesses
7. The word of the day changes everyday. The user effectively has a 24h time limit>
